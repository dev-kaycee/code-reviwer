Code Review Automation is a powerful tool for software development teams that want to streamline their code review process and ensure that their codebase is up to par.
This project involves creating an app that integrates with GitHub and Dropbox to automate the code review process.

## Here's how it works:

When a team member submits a code change to the GitHub repository, the app monitors the repository for changes.
When a change is detected, the app downloads the code changes from GitHub into a designated folder in Dropbox.
The app then runs tests and analysis on the code, using tools such as static code analysis and test suites, to identify potential issues or errors.
After the tests and analysis are complete, the app generates a report and provides feedback to the team, highlighting any issues or areas that require attention.
The team can then review the report and address any issues before merging the changes into the main branch of the codebase.
By automating the code review process, teams can save time and ensure that their code is of high quality. The integration with Dropbox also allows team members to access the code changes and review reports from anywhere, making it easier to collaborate on code review.

Overall, Code Review Automation can help software development teams to improve their code quality and streamline their code review process, ultimately leading to more efficient and effective software development.
